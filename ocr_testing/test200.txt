Colleagues vs Clients

Raga was a business graduate from the US and was planning to settle in India after spending a
decade working in US. She got a couple of offers and took up employment in an Indian MNC that
mainly offered IT consulting and was a very well established consultant brand. She was placed as
a senior management resource in the company and was to lead a team of 15 consultants.
Of late, she had been receiving several grievances mails from a new French client. This client was
raising issues and complaining that their consultants were not up to the mark. Raga planned to
speak to the clients and ascertain what their issues were. The objective of doing this was to find
out the ‘hidden areas’ of the client and reduce the ‘blind area’ (Johari’s Window). Raga started
probing the client and found out two major issues. The first was lack of accountability amongst
consultants and the abysmally low communication engagement levels with the client. Some of the
key points that the client mentioned were as follows: r
« Inability of the team of consultants to interact with thé client’s team abroad.
* Differences in the ‘attitude’ towards work among the consultants. There were unnecessary
delays whenever a solution was asked for.
« Some of the meetings started after schedule; with some of the key members joining after
the meeting had started.
e Feedback from the ‘consultants’ was very poor as they would say a ‘yes’ to everything
and would act as if everything was going fine.
e The team of consultants, although technically very sound, needed to improve their
attitude towards work, behavior and communication.
Raga felt that there was a need now to improve her compatibility with the team, and the first step
that she took was to introduce daily team meetings. The purpose of the meetings was simple:
understand each other better, delineate the role each one of the team members was playing, and
tackle the challenges the team was facing in dealing with the client.
After a couple of meetings with her team, she discovered the following deficiencies:
¢ The bonding of the team members was extremely weak, and they knew very little about
each other. The team members did not know much about the backgrounds of the other
PTO
consultants, their likes and dislikes, and some basic information that every team member
should know about another.

« The major challenge was that the client spoke French, a language with which the
consultants were not very comfortable. Moreover, the client’s representatives spoke very
little English. This acted as a major communication barrier.

« The complaints that the consultants raised were to do with poor feedback from the clients.
Lack of interaction because of the language barrier had caused this situation. The client
did not ‘speak out’ on their key issues or challenges and kept quiet till the last moment.

¢ Because a number of the consultants had resigned, and the gap was filled by new recruits,
there was no consistent single point of contact for the client.

¢ There was a lot of miscommunication between the client and the team of consultants. The
miscommunication had been caused by cultural differences in the approach towards work,
and the team of consultants had virtually no power or authority to solve the client’s
problems by providing ‘out of box’ solutions. All the consultants had to follow strict
guidelines necessitated approvals from the higher management, which resulted in delays.

* The team had suggested and communicated a grievances solution mechanism to the client.
However, this mechanism did not take off. The team sent an email to the client,
explaining the work process; however, the client did not take this mail seriously. (The
team also suggested that probably email was a wrong medium to address this problem,
and a one-to-one interaction would have been better.)

« The emails and letters that were exchanged with the clients were difficult for either side
to interpret because of the language barrier. The consultants needed to get issues clarified
many times before they actually understood what the real problem was. Similarly, the
emails written by the consultants were too concise for the client, and the client found it
difficult to understand them.

With all these problems, Raga realized that there was major communication gap between the
consultants and the clients. She understood she had lots to do.
